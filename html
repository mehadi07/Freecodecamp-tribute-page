          Here's a time line of <strong>Dennis Ritchie</strong>
  </h4>
      <ul class="timeline">
        <li><strong>1941</strong> - Born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronxville,_New_York">Bronxville </a>, New York, U.S</li>
        <li><strong>1967</strong> - Ritchie began working at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs">Bell Labs</a> Computing Sciences Research Center.<br>
        </li>
        <li><strong>1968</strong> - he defended his PhD thesis on "Program Structure and Computational Complexity" at Harvard under the supervision of Patrick C. Fischer. However, Ritchie never officially received his PhD degree.</li>
        <li><strong>1970</strong> - Ritchie has described a 1970s collaboration with James Reeds and Robert Morris on a ciphertext-only attack on the M-209 US cipher machine that could solve messages of at least 2000â€“2500 letters. Ritchie relates that, after discussions with the NSA, the authors decided not to publish it, as they were told the principle was applicable to machines then still in use by foreign governments</li>
          
        <li><strong>1983</strong> In 1983, Ritchie and Thompson received the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award">Turing Award</a> for their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system. Ritchie's Turing Award lecture was titled "Reflections on Software Research"</li>
        
          <li><strong>1990</strong> - both Ritchie and Thompson received the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_Richard_W._Hamming_Medal">IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal </a> from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), "for the origination of the UNIX operating system and the C programming language"</li>
          <li><strong>1998</strong> - President Bill Clinton for co-inventing the UNIX operating system and the C programming language which, according to the citation for the medal, "led to enormous advances in computer hardware, software, and networking systems and stimulated growth of an entire industry, thereby enhancing American leadership in the Information Age"</li>
        <li><strong>2005</strong> - the Industrial Research Institute awarded Ritchie its  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRI_Achievement_Award">Achievement Award </a> in recognition of his contribution to science and technology, and to society generally, with his development of the Unix operating system.</li>
        
        <li><strong>2011</strong> - Ritchie, along with Thompson, was awarded the Japan Prize for Information and Communications for his work in the development of the Unix operating system</li>
          
        <li><strong>2011</strong> - at the age of 70 at his home in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, where he lived alone </li>
